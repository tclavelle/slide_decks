# What is Shiny?

&gt; *Shiny is an R package that combines the computational power of R with the interactivity of the modern web. Shiny apps can be hosted on a webpage, embedded in RMarkdown documents, or used as dashboards. They can also be extended using CSS, htmlwidgets, and JavaScript.*

I *highly* recommend using the `shinydashboard` package, which makes it even easier to create nice looking "dashboard" style Shiny apps


```r
install.packages(c('shiny','shinydashboard'))
```

---

# Why use Shiny?

For my job, I have found Shiny to be incredibly useful for two different reasons:

--

1. [Exploring preliminary results with collaborators](https://tylerclavelle.shinyapps.io/gfr-kobe/)

  - Quick and comprehensive way to review results without spamming people's inbox with figures and tables
  
  - Often the code is mostly written and you just need to make a quick user interface (ui)

--

2. [Sharing results with stakeholders](https://tylerclavelle.shinyapps.io/sardine_dashboard_v2/)

  - 80 page static PDF report? **Sad!**

  - Dynamic application that allows stakeholders to interact with the results? **Tremendous!**

---

# What's in a Shiny App? 

A Shiny "app" refers to one (or more) R scripts and contains two main components:
  1. The **server** - R code that does *analysis* (calculations, models, figures, etc.) and will *react* to user input
  2. The **user interface (ui)** - R code that tells the Shiny package what to *display*. Can include regular text along with user *inputs* (sliders, check boxes, dropdowns, etc.) and server *outputs* (figures, tables, numbers)  
  
--
  
Shiny apps are contained in their own **directory** (folder) and can either be built using a single script named `app.R` (simple applications) or two separate scripts, `server.R` and `ui.R`. 
  - a `global.R` file can also be used for things you might want available to both the `server.R` and `ui.R` scripts (e.g. packages, data)
  
---

# How Shiny Works

To demonstrate how Shiny works, i'm going to walk through a few components of the apps I built as examples.  

Specifically, i'm going to explain the basics behind the following:  
  * building the application layout with `ui.R`
  * creating and naming **inputs**
  * rendering and naming **outputs**
  * running analysis in `server.R` that *react* to user inputs and *render* objects

# User Interface

---

# User Interface

The first step is to create a new dashboard with `dashboardPage()`, give it a title, and create a `menuItem()` for each page of the application.

```r
## ui.R ##
library(shinydashboard)

## Create dashboard
*dashboardPage(
* dashboardHeader(title = 'Fishery Simulator'),
    ## Sidebar content
*   dashboardSidebar(
*     sidebarMenu(
*       menuItem("Overview", tabName = "overview", icon = icon("home")),
        menuItem("The Fishery", tabName = "fishery", icon = icon("ship")),
        menuItem('Parameters', tabName = 'parameters', icon = icon('cog')),
        menuItem("Fishery Model", tabName = "model", icon = icon("area-chart")),
        menuItem("Methods", tabName = "methods", icon = icon("list"))
      )
    ),
```

---

# User Interface

Next, in the `dashboardBody()`, create a page layout for each `menuItem()`. These layouts can be as simple or complex as you want. Fortunately, `shinydashboard` makes this really easy by using `box()`

```r
  ## Create the dashboard body
* dashboardBody(
    # Build pages for each menu item
    tabItems(
      # Overview tab
*     tabItem(tabName = "overview",
             # Page has one row
             fluidRow(
                # The row contains a box names "Overview"
*               box(title = 'Overview', solidHeader = TRUE, status = 'primary',
*                   width = 12,
*                   includeMarkdown(path = 'sardine_overview.Rmd'))
              )
      ),
```

---

# Creating Inputs

**`ui.R`** - create an input widget and assign it a name
```r
box(solidHeader = TRUE, status = 'info', width = NA,
  # Closed season months
* sliderInput('season', label = 'Set closed season (months):',
              min = 1, max = 12, value = c(1,3))) 
```

**`server.R`** - reference that input value like you would any other value in R using `input$&lt;name&gt;`. Server code will automatically *react* when `input$&lt;name&gt;` changes
```r
# generate vector of closed season months 
closed_season &lt;- reactive({
*closed_period &lt;- seq(from = input$season[1], 
*                     to = input$season[2], by = 1)
  return(closed)
})
```

---

# Creating Outputs

Outputs are R objects that we want to display in the application. They are (shocker) the *output* of R code run in `server.R` (figures, values, tables, etc.) and will update if the user changes an `input$&lt;name&gt;` they *depend* on.  
  
Outputs are created by pairing two types of functions, `render*()` functions in `server.R` and `*Output()` functions in `ui.R`:  

--

.pull-left[
#### Render functions in `server.R`
`renderPlot()`  
`renderTable()`  
`renderText()`
]

--

.pull-right[
#### Matching output functions in `ui.R`
`plotOutput()`  
`tableOutput()`  
`textOutput()`
]

---

# Creating Outputs

**`server.R`** - *render* an R object and assign it a name using `output$&lt;name&gt;`
```r
# Render simulation plots
output$sim_catch_plot &lt;- renderPlot({ simModelPlots()[['catchPlot']] })
```

 **`ui.R`** - tell Shiny where to display the `output$&lt;name&gt;` object rendered in `server.R` by referencing its *name* in `ui.R`  
```r
fluidRow(
  # Catch simulation plot
  tabBox(title = 'Catch', width = NULL,
          tabPanel("Projections",
*                   plotOutput('sim_catch_plot', height = '250px'))
```
---

# Reactivity

Reactive functions are what allow Shiny apps to be interactive and respond to user input. In a nutshell, these functions in `server.R` **react** when an `input$&lt;name&gt;` they depend on changes.  

There are several types of reactive functions in Shiny:  

* `render*()` functions - create specific object types (plots, tables, text)
* `reactive()` functions - user defined functions that can perform any analysis that depends on an `input$&lt;name&gt;` from `ui.R`
  
There are more types of reactive functions in Shiny (`observeEvent()`, `isolate()`, etc.), but they are less common
